## [LINK TO FIGMA](https://www.figma.com/file/2FIzIuiFeHaWlNsjF0Z2gE/Keyring-Multistep-Modal-Form?node-id=0%3A1)

## Description

You're going to create a multistep form based on an in Figma pre-designed reference. During the implementation you're taking care of:

- Structuring your workspace and code.
- Converting styles (color, fonts, shapes, ...) into reusable components.
- Pixel perfection, staying close as possible to the reference (Figma).
- Commenting, if necessary for understanding your code.

## What we pay attention to:

- Coding Style (like naming, code splitting, prop-types, DRY)
- Accuracy in the implementation of the design (Figma)
- Structuring of the app and components
- Use of best practices and established solutions to get the job done (instead of reinventing the wheel)

## Minimum Requirement:

- Converting the Figma Design into a monolith react app

## Advanced Requirement

- Structuring app into reusable components
- Write tests (with Jest or React Testing Library)
- Collect your ideas for UI/UX improvements

# Please Notice

- Use demodata.json according to the example in Figma
- Preferable work with [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui), it's already added to the environment.
